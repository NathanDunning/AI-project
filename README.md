# COMP307 Assignment 1
My project is written in Java. When running the project please ensure that the test file contains the word "test" and the training data contains the word "training" anywhere in the file name. This ensures my program can correctly identify which set is the training set and which data set is the test set.

## Part 1
Part 1 can be found in the source folder under the package '**part1**' all necessary files are contained within that package. When passing in the files as the arguments, please ensure that the files are placed in a folder located in 'data/part1/_filename_'
After running, the program will output a text file to the root directory containing the results.

The initial value of k is set to 3 but can be changed through the variable 'k' in the field located in NearestNeighbour.java
