# COMP307 Assignment 1
My project is written in Java. When running the project please ensure that the test file contains the word "test" and the training data contains the word "training" anywhere in the file name. This ensures my program can correctly identify which set is the training set and which data set is the test set.

## Part 1
Part 1 can be found in the source folder under the package '**part1**' all necessary files are contained within that package. When passing in the files as the arguments, the program searches in the root directory of the project for the files so ensure the two text files are placed in the root directory or specify the path in the argument.

After running, the program will output a text file to the root directory containing the results.

For part 1, all parts are completed except for the implementation of K-Means Clustering method.
