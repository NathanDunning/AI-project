# COMP307 Assignment 1
My project is written in Java. When running the project please ensure that the test file contains the word "test" and the training data contains the word "training" anywhere in the file name. This ensures my program can correctly identify which set is the training set and which data set is the test set. 
The three parts include the implementation of 
* K-Nearest Neighbours
* Decision Trees
* Perceptrons
Complete code has been implemented and working for all parts

## Part 1
Part 1 can be found in the source folder under the package '**part1**' all necessary files are contained within that package. When passing in the files as the arguments, please ensure that the files are placed in a folder located in 'data/part1/_filename_' and not in the root folder.
After running, the program will output a text file to the root directory containing the results.

The initial value of k is set to 3 but can be changed through the variable 'k' in the field located in NearestNeighbour.java

For part 1, all parts are completed except for the implementation of K-Means Clustering method.

MainClass = NearestNeighbour.java

## Part 2
Part 2 can be found in the source folder with all necessary files under the package '**part2**'. When passing in data files through arguments, ensure that all data files are placed in a directory located at 'data/part2/_filename_' and not in the root folder. 

All output for part 2 will be through the terminal/console.

MainClass = DecisionTree.java

## Part 3
Part 3 can be found in the source folder under the package '**part3**'. When passing in data through the arguments, ensure that all data files are place in the directory 'data/part3/_filename_' and not in the root folder.

Within the Perceptron.java class, there are multiple print statements that have been commented out, by uncommenting you will be able to see the weights at every iteration and whether the images have been guessed correctly through each iteration

All output will be to the terminal/console.

MainClass = Perceptron.java
